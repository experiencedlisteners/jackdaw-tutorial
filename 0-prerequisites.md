# Prerequisites

Familiarity with the Unix command line, Common Lisp, and probability theory are independently helpful but not strictly required.

If you use a modern Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution such as Ubuntu, you should be able to follow along by copying and pasting from the tutorial.

If you use Mac OS/X, you can copy and paste some of the commands below but need to follow alternative instructions for Mac in some places.

If you are using Windows, you are welcome to try and set everything up in.
If you know what you are doing, it should be possible.

Otherwise, I recommend installing Ubuntu in VirtualBox on Windows.
This installs the Ubuntu operating system in a *virtual machine*: a computer that is simulated from within Windows.
After doing this, you can boot up your virtual Ubuntu computer and follow the instructions below.

You could for example follow [these instructions](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-Ubuntu-on-VirtualBox), but download Ubuntu 20.04 (the Desktop edition), instead of 19.04.
It shouldn't be hard to do, but it might take some time.
While you don't need to attend to it all the time, downloading and installing Ubuntu may take between 10 and 60 minutes, depending on the speed of your computer and internet connection).
