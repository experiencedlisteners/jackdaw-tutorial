;; You'll notice that this domain-general solution is somewhat inefficient as we have to loop
;; over event domain twice (inverse viewpoint functions can solve the second issue).
;; Also undefined cannot be handled properly (not that pitch-interval will generate one value
;; as long as it is undefined which is only in the first moment)
;; Furthermore, when defining the viewpoint, we have to account for the case that we're
;; in the first moment. E.g., pitch interval looks like this:
;; 
;; (defvar +undefined+ 'âŸ‚)
;; 
;; (defparameter *viewpoint*
;;   (make-derived-viewpoint-model
;;    (loop for pitch below 128 collect pitch)
;;    (lambda (events)
;;      (if (< (length events) 2) +undefined+
;; 	 (- (first events) (second events))))
;;    :observe '(event)))
;;
;; To inspect the viewpoint elements after the last moment in the right order
;; (reverse
;;  (first
